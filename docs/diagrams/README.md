## TLDraw

Some diagrams included in this repository use [TLDraw](https://tldraw.dev/). This is convenient for keeping the original diagram source in the same repository as the generated diagram images that are used in the documentaiton.

TLDraw files use the file extension `.tldr`. These files can be edited using web based editors such as at [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/). There are free extensions for many popular code development applications.
