				PCGL is aware that some countries/regions do not require ethics approval for use of coded data (i.e. use of the
				PCGL Controlled Data). Depending on the nature of your research project, it is possible, however, that such
				approval is needed in your country. If you are uncertain as to whether your research project needs ethics
				approval to use PCGL Controlled Data, we suggest you contact your local institutional review board / research
				ethics committee (IRB/REC) to clarify the matter.
			</Paragraph>

				Please note: The PCGL DACO and the PCGL are not responsible for the ethics approval/monitoring of individual
				research projects and bear no responsibility for the applicant's failure to comply with local/national ethical
				requirements.

					Your country/region requires your Research Project to undergo ethics review, and therefore, this research
