/**
 * Restrict a component from rendering if authorization rules are not met. Can be added
 * around any component to prevent the component from rendering if the user roles are not
 * correct.
 *
 * By default, users must be logged in to see the component.
 *
 * To restrict a component to only users of a specific role, you can add the `requiredRoles` prop. If you do,
 * only users with one of the required roles will be able to access that component.
 * 
 * To restrict a component to only show when in a certain state, you can add the `requiredStates` prop. If you do, 
 * a component will only be visible if the app is in a certain state.
 
 * @example
 * <div>
 *  <ProtectedComponent requiredRoles={['DAC_MEMBER']} requiredStates={['DRAFT']}>
 *      <Button>Button for DACs only<Button/>
 * </ProtectedComponent>
 * </div>
