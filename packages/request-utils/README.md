# DACO Request Utilities
A package containing utilities useful for processing express requests.

## Purpose
This package contains utilities useful for processing express requests, including Zod validation as middleware, and implementation of centralized request error handling. 

This package was originally based on [OHCRN's `express-request-validation`](https://github.com/OHCRN/platform/tree/develop/packages/express-request-validation) package. Although it has been modified to fit DACO's use case.
